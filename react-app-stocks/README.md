# React App Stocks
First project using ReactJS. I decided to an app that allows me to search for stocks, stock data and news. I used Tailwind CSS and Recharts for this app.

## Getting Started
App has not been deployed. App is created using npm-create-react-app.

## Project Description
App has 3 main purposes.
Firstly to search for stock symbols which will allow us to display the details and data for the chart.
Secondly, there is a chart with filters to display the price data of the stocks.
Lastly, the news section. Initially, I intended for the news section to be related to the stock that is searched. However since there were issues with the API, I just used a different endpoint to display general news.

## Acknowledgements
Tailwind CSS helped me alot with the styling for this app. 
Recharts charting library helped me display the chart data nicely.
Not forgetting GA instructor Desmond and IA Vithya for building the foundation in learning how to use React and answering all the questions I have for this project.
